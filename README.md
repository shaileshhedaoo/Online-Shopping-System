Case Study: Online Shopping System

Create a simplified online shopping system in Java, incorporating fundamental concepts such as classes, inheritance, and exception handling.

Requirements:

Create a Product Class:

Implement a Product class with attributes productName (String), productId (int), price (double), and quantityInStock (int).
Include a method displayDetails to print details of the product.
Derived Classes - Electronics and Clothing:

Create two classes, Electronics and Clothing, that inherit from the Product class.
Add attributes specific to each type (e.g., brand and warrantyPeriod for electronics, size and material for clothing).
Override the displayDetails method in each derived class to include information about the specific attributes.
Shopping Cart:

Create a ShoppingCart class to manage the user's shopping cart.
Include methods to add products to the cart, display the cart contents, and calculate the total price.
User Input and Exception Handling:

In the testing phase, simulate user input for adding electronics and clothing to the shopping cart.
Implement exception handling to ensure valid inputs for product creation (e.g., non-empty product name, positive product ID).
